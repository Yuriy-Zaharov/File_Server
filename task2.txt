Networking
Description
Our objective is to make the files stored on our file server accessible through the Internet. To achieve that,
we need two separate programs: a file server, which stores our files and processes client requests, and a client,
which will be used to make requests to create, get, and delete files on our server.

Let's consider an important term for this stage: socket. A socket is an interface used to send and receive data between
different processes running either on the same computer or on different computers connected through the Internet.

In this stage, you will implement the simplest connection between one server and one client. The client should send
the message Give me everything you have! to the server, and the server should reply All files were sent!.
Both the client and the server should print the received messages to the console.

The very first message the server outputs before the client connects to it should be Server started!.

To connect to the server, the client must know the server's address. The address consists of two parts:
the IP address and the port number. In your program, you will use the IP address 127.0.0.1,
which is the localhost (your own computer). The port can be any number from 0 to 65535, but preferably higher than 1024.
The server and the client should use the same IP address and port number; otherwise, they won't find each other.

To start, import java.io.* and java.net.* , which are necessary for input/output operations with the socket.

Let's take a look at the client-side code:

String address = "127.0.0.1";
int port = 23456;
Socket socket = new Socket(InetAddress.getByName(address), port);
DataInputStream input = new DataInputStream(socket.getInputStream());
DataOutputStream output = new DataOutputStream(socket.getOutputStream());

The client creates a new socket, which means that it's trying to connect to the server.
The successful creation of a socket means that the client has found the server and connected to it.

After that, you can see the creation of the DataInputStream and DataOutputStream objects.
These are input and output connections to the server. If you expect data from the server, you need to write input.readUTF().
This returns the String object that the server sent to the client. If you want to send data to the server,
you need to write output.writeUTF(stringText), and the message will be sent to the server.

Now, let's look at the server-side code:

String address = "127.0.0.1";
int port = 23456;
ServerSocket server = new ServerSocket(port, 50, InetAddress.getByName(address));
Socket socket = server.accept();
DataInputStream input = new DataInputStream(socket.getInputStream());
DataOutputStream output  = new DataOutputStream(socket.getOutputStream());
The server creates a ServerSocket object that listens for client connections. When the client connects,
the server.accept() method returns the socket connection to the client. After that, two objects are created:
DataInputStream and DataOutputStream. These are the input and output connections to the client, now from the server side.
To receive data from the client, you need to write input.readUTF(). To send data to the client, write output.writeUTF(stringText).

You should create two packages named client and server and then create Main.java in both of these packages.
Both classes should contain the public static void main(String[] args) method. To start the server,
just run main from the server package. To start the client, run main from the client package.
The tests depend on the presence of these classes!

Finally, make sure to close all the sockets and streams!

Objectives
In this stage, your client-side program should:

Print Client started! when the program starts.
Send the message Give me everything you have! to the server.
Receive a response message from the server.
Your server-side program should:

Print Server started! when the program starts.
Receive a message from the client.
Send the response message All files were sent! to the client.
Be sure to print the sent and received messages in both programs.

Example
The server output should look like this:

Server started!
Received: Give me everything you have!
Sent: All files were sent!


The client output should be as follows:

Client started!
Sent: Give me everything you have!
Received: All files were sent!
